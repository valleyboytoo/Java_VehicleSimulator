# Java_VehicleSimulator

# SPECIFICATIONS 

This simulation is all about the architecture and functionality not the appearance. Providing GUI is a bonus. 
This application requires you to use specific polymorphism structure, composition, inheritance. Certain methods will require you to use exception handling. 
When the application starts, the console will prompt the user to input following values : 
• Length of each quadrants. 
• Number of vehicles. 
• Number of each vehicle type. 

When the specifications are done, program initialized the field and populate the vehicles (Car, Truck, SportsCar, Tractor) of random types in a random position in random quadrants. Coordinate of the center of the field is always (0, 0), each quadrant is always a right triangle and length of each quadrants are all same. 
All vehicles move in their own pattern each turn. Details will be specified later. 
When all the vehicles are dead, User should be able to see top 3 vehicles of each kind that lasted the longest and the details of those vehicles.
